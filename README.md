# PowerShell and Power Automate Integration for Approval Workflows

## Overview
This PowerShell function, `Start-PowerAutomateApproval`, demonstrates an integration with Power Automate to trigger dynamic approval workflows. It sends an approval request to a specified Power Automate flow and waits for the response in real-time.

## Functionality
The function sends an approval request with details such as title, assignee, and approval content, then polls for the approval result at specified intervals.

## Prerequisites
- Power Automate flow with an HTTP trigger configured for approval workflows.
- An endpoint URL obtained from the Power Automate flow to be used as `$logicAppUrl` in the PowerShell function.

## How to Use
1. Define the parameters for the approval request.
2. Call the function with the required parameters.
3. The function will send the request and wait for the approval to be processed.

## Parameters
- `Title`: The title of the approval request.
- `AssignedTo`: The approver's email address.
- `Details`: Detailed information about the approval request.
- `Waitseconds`: The time in seconds between each poll for the approval response.

## Usage Example
```powershell
Start-PowerAutomateApproval -Title "Server Access Request" `
                            -AssignedTo "approver@example.com" `
                            -Details "Requesting access to the production server." `
                            -Waitseconds 30
```

## Response Handling
The function waits for the approval response and then outputs the result which includes the decision, any comments, and the user who approved the request.
